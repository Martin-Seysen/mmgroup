Applications of the **mmgroup** package
=======================================


Introduction
============

Some applications using the *mmgroup* package can be downloaded from
the github repository

https://github.com/Martin-Seysen/mmgroup .

In that repository each application is stored in a subdirectory of 
directory ``applications``.

The *mmgroup* package must be installed before running any of these
applications, as described in the **API reference** of this project.
