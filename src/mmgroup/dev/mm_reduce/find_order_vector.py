r"""This module computes an order vector in a representation of the monster.

In :cite:`Seysen22` we define a vector :math:`v_1` in the 
representation  :math:`\rho_{15}` of the monster group 
:math:`\mathbb{M}` that is used for recognizing elements of the 
subgroup :math:`G_{x0}` of :math:`\mathbb{M}`. Vector :math:`v_1`
is also used for computing the order of an element of 
:math:`\mathbb{M}`, so we call  :math:`v_1` an **order vector**
here.

:math:`v_1` is constructed from two vectors :math:`v_{71} \in \rho_3`
and :math:`v_{94} \in \rho_5` via Chinese remaindering. This module
contains functions for computing vectors  :math:`v_{71}` and
:math:`v_{94}` with the properties required in :cite:`Seysen22`.

These computations are the most time-consuming part of the
computation of :math:`v_1`; and we use multiprocessing for 
performing these computations. 

All computations in the monster group are done with instances 
of class ``MM0``, but not ``MM``. The reason for this is that 
class ``MM`` requires the existence of an order vector.

    Function ``par_search`` executes ``f(*args)`` repeatedly until 
    a result different from ``None`` is returned. Then function 
    ``par_search`` returns that result.
    
    Execution of ``f`` is repeated (at least) ``trials`` times.
    If ``f`` returns ``None`` in all cases then ``ValueError`` is
    raised. 
    
    Execution of function ``f`` runs in parallel. The number of
    parallel processes is equal to ``os.cpu_count()``. One can 
    use the keyword argument ``processes`` to adjust the number 
    of processes.
    
    In each round function ``f`` is executed ``chunksize`` times,
    where ``chunksize`` can be given by a keyword argument. By
    default we make an educated guess for a good chunk size.
    If ``chunksize`` is too small then there might be too much 
    overhead for setting up the parallelization. If ``chunksize``
    is too large then one must always wait for at least
    ``chunksize`` executions of ``f``, even if the probability
    of success is much larger than ``1 / chunksize``.    
    
    Function ``f`` usually calls a random generator for obtaining
    test values. That random generator should return different 
    random  data when running in different processes. Here a 
    random generator like ``random.randint()`` is ok.

    Preferably, the arguments in ``args`` should be simple objects
    like numbers or strings or lists of such simple objects.  You
    must be aware of the fact that each process works on its own
    copy of the input data.
