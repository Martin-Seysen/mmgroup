r"""This module implements Norton's generators of the Monster.

Norton :cite:`Nor02` has given a presentation of the Monster group
that greatly simplifies a mapping from the *projecive plane*
presentation of the Monster to the representation of the Monster
in :cite:`Gri82` and :cite:`Con85`. Our implemention of the 
Monster is based on the representation in :cite:`Con85`. So we may
use the presentation in :cite:`Nor02` to construct a homomorphism
from the  *projecive plane* representation of the Monster into our
implementation of the Monster that can be computed in practice.

def MM_from_perm(perm, verbose = 0):
    r"""Map an element of ``AutP3`` into the Monster group

    Here parameter ``perm`` is a list of 13 integers
    ``0 <= perm[i] < 13`` such that the mapping ``i -> perm[i]`` is
    an automorphism ``a`` of points of the projective plane ``P3``.

    The function maps automorphsm ``a`` into the subgroup ``G_x0``
    of the Monster. Therefore it uses the operation of ``a`` on the
    points and stars for constructing the iamge ``g`` of ``a`` in 
    ``G_x0``.  Here ``a`` operates (by conjugation) on the 'points' 
    and 'stars', which are elements of the extraspecial subgroup 
    ``Q_x0`` of structure :math:`2^{1+24}` of ``G_x0``.

    Note that this operation of ``a`` determines the element ``g``
    of the subgroup ``G_x0`` of the Monster up to sign only. We use
    the C function ``xsp2co1_elem_from_mapping``  for constructing
    one of the elements ``+g`` or ``-g``. At most one of these two
    elements may have odd order, and we compute the element of odd
    order if such an element exists. Thus, if ``a`` has odd order
    then the returned element ``g`` is the correct image of ``a``.

    More precisely, we return a triple ``(g, order, special)``,
    where ``g`` is the image of ``a``  in ``G_x0`` given as an
    instance of class ``MM``.  Here ``order`` is the order of ``g``,
    which is odd if possible. The part ``special`` of the result
    is ``True`` if the function can distinguish between ``g`` and 
    ``-g`` by computing the orders and certain characters of these 
    two elements in ``G_x0``.
    
    Remark:

    If ``MM_from_perm(a1)`` returns ``(g1, order, True)``, and the 
    automorphism ``a2`` of ``AutP3`` is conjugate to ``a1`` then
    ``MM_from_perm(a2)`` returns ``(g2, order, True)``; and it is
    guaranteed that ``g2`` is conjugate to ``g1``, but not to ``-g1``
    in ``G_x0``. So once we know the 'right' image ``+g1`` or ``-g1``
    of ``a1``, we can also deduce the  'right' image ``+g2`` or
    ``-g2`` of ``a2``.

    The group ``AutP3`` is isomorphic to :math:`L_3(3)` in ATLAS
    notation. From the ATLAS we see that for each even order the
    group :math:`L_3(3)` has at most on conjugacy class with that
    order. So if ``MM_from_perm(a)`` returns ``(g, order, True)``
    for an even ``order``, and we have found the 'right' image
    ``g`` or ``-g`` of ``a``, then we can easily find the 'right'
    images of all other elements of ``AutP3`` of the same order.
   
    If cannot find the 'right' image ``+-g`` of an element ``a`` of
    ``AutP3`` that way, then we may always decompose ``a`` into a 
    (random) product of elements of odd order.

        Here the tansversal has size 156 and the subgroup fixing points

        fixing ponts ``0`` and ``1`` that maps the points ``2`` 
        and ``5`` to the points ``i`` and ``j``. 

        Each entry ``e`` of ``cls.transversal`` is an array of 27

        ``e[i]`` is the image of the point ``P_i``, and ``e[13+i]``
        is the preimage of ``P_i`` under the automporphism ``a``.

        The entry with index 1 (corresponding to the identity in
