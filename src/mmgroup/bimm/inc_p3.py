r"""The module implements the projective plane over :math:`\mathbb{F}_3`


Module ``inc_p3`` implements the projective plane ``P3`` over
:math:`\mathbb{F}_3` and its automorphism group. Points and lines
in ``P3`` are implemented as instances of class ``P3_node``,
automorphisms of ``P3`` are implemented as instances of 
class ``AutP3``. 

We mainly work with the incidence graph containing the points
and the lines of ``P3`` as vertices.
The union of the set of the points and of the set of the lines 
in ``P3`` is called the set of the *nodes* of the projective 
plane ``P3``.

    r"""Models an automorphism of the projective plane ``P3``.

    This class models the automorphism group ``AutP3`` of the 
    projective plane ``P3`` over the field :math:`\mathbb{F}_3`.

    Elements of ``AutP3`` should be given as (partial) mappings of 
    points or lines. The standard way to describe an automorphism  
    in ``AutP3`` is a dictionary containing a partial mapping 
    of points or lines. Here the keys and the values of the
    dictionary must either all be points or all lines; they must be
    objects describing points or lines as in the constructor of
    class ``AutP3``. A mapping between points or lines is accepted
    if it extends to a unique mapping of the projective plane ``P3``. 


    :param mapping:

      Describes a mapping of points or lines in the projective
      plane ``P3`` as indicated in the table below.

    :param data:

      Additional data (optional) that describe a mapping of points 
      or lines in some special cases.

      ``None``         Creates the neutral element (default).
  

      class ``AutP3``  A deep copy of the given automorphism in class
                       ``AutP3`` is returned. 
  
      ``dict``         Dictionary containing a mapping between points or
                       lines as described above.

      ``zip`` object   ``zip(x,y)`` is equivalent to ``dict(zip(x,y))``

      ``string`` 'r'   Then we construct a random automorphism (depending
                       on parameter ``data``) as described below. 

      ``string`` 'p'   Then ``data`` must be a list of 13 integers (taken
                       modulo 13), that describes a mapping of the 
                       13 points. 

      ``string`` 'l'   Then ``data`` must be a list of 13 integers (taken
                       modulo 13), that describes a mapping of the 
                       13 lines. 
      ================ ===================================================



    Remarks:

    If parameter ``mapping`` is the string ``'r'``, then an optional
    parameter ``data`` of type ``dict`` or ``zip`` that describes a 
    partial mapping of points or lines may follow. In this case we 
    construct a random  automorphism of ``P3`` satifying the 
    constraints of the mapping given by parameter ``data``, if present.
    Such a random automorphism  is chosen from a uniform distribution 
    of all possible cases.

    For instances ``g1`` and ``g2`` of this class,
    ``g1 * g2``  means group multiplication, and ``g1 ** n`` means
    exponentiation of ``g1`` with the integer ``n``. ``g1 ** (-1)`` 
    is the inverse of ``g``. ``g1 / g2`` means ``g1 * g2 ** (-1)``.

    ``g1 ** g2`` means ``g2**(-1) * g1 * g2``. 

    Multiplying an object of class ``P3_node`` with an object
    of class ``AutP3`` means application of an automorphism of ``P3``
    to a point or line in ``P3``.
