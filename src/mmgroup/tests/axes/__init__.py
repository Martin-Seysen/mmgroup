"""This is yet a stub and will de documented if future releases

The purpose of this module is to give the user access to
representatives of the orbits of the group :math:`G_{x0}` on
the 2A axes in the Monster. 

A similar function for obtaining the orbits on the 2A axes in
the Baby Monster will also be provided. 

Currently this information is available in the submodules of
module ``mmgroup.tests.test_axes``. It is a rather messy state
so that we'd better clean up before documenting it.
