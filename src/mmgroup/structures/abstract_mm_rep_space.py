"""Abstract model of a representation the monster group

Let R_p be the 196884-dimensional representation 196884x of the monster 
group modulo a small odd number p as described in [Seys19]. Class
AbstractMmRepSpace is an abstract class for modelling representation
R_p. A small odd modulus p < 256 is passed to the constructor of that
class as well as a class modelling the monster group Mm.

The user should refer to the concrete class mmgroup.MMSpace instead.

Class AbstractMmRepSpace handles the input and output of vectors 
in R_p. Here a basis vector of R_p is constructed from a tuple 
(tag, i0, i1), where the tag is a single capital letter as described 
in file mm_aux.c, and i0 and i1 are integers describing the basis 
vector.

Method unit() of class AbstractMmRepSpace constructs a basis vector
from a tuple (tag, i0, i1j). Standard operators "+" and "*" can be 
used for vector addition and scalar multiplication, and also for 
right multiplication of a vector by a group element. Optionally, a 
tuple (scalar, tag, i0, i1) can be passed with 'scalar' an integer 
or a specific small letter indicating a random scalar.

Since class AbstractMmRepSpace is a subclass of class AbstractRepSpace,
vectors of R_p can also be constructed by calling an instance of a
suitable subclass of class AbstractMmRepSpace with arguments describing 
the vector to be constructed. See method __call__ in class 
AbstractRepSpace for details.

The monster group Mm acting on R_p by right multiplication is modelled
by an instance of subclass of class mmgroup.structures.AbstractGroup.
Such a class has methods for generating elements of Mm. The operation 
of x in Mm on v in R_p is simply coded as v * x.

Class AbstractMmRepSpace is an abstract class that supports two
implementations of the concrete class mmgroup.MMVector. 


Internal operation
------------------

The representation (tag, i0, i1) of a basis vector of R_p is human
readable and in one-to-one correspondence with the description of 
basis vectors of R_p in [Seys19]. On the C level, dealing with
tuples and characters causes unnecessary overhead. Here we 
represent a scalar multiple of a basis vector in the so-called
sparse format. This means that a multiple of a basis vector is
represented as an unsigned 32-bit integer, where certain bit fields
of the integer correspond to the parts (scalar, tag, i0, i1) of the 
tuple, and another bit field corresponds to the coordinate.
Details are given in the documentation of the module mm_aux.c.
Vectors in R_p are can also be represented as arrays of 32-bit
integers. That representation of a vector is called the 'sparse'
representation. 

In python, a sparse representation of a vector in R_p is implemented
as a one-dimension numpy array of dtype np.uint32. 

Class AbstractMmRepSpace handles the operations on vectors an group
elements. It makes no specific assumptions on the internal 
representation of a vector or a group element. Thus it can easily be 
adjusted to a fast C implementation of the group operation on vectors.

However, class  AbstractMmRepSpace assumes that conversion between 
the internal format and the sparse format of a vector is supported, 
e.g. by fast C routines. It handles the conversion between the sparse
representation of a vector and the representation of a vector as a
list of tuples. This includes the implementation of the usual methods
__getitem__ and __setitem__ for vectors.

Caution!
v['A', i, j] and v['A', j, i] refer to the same coordinate of 
vector v. Item assignment is done in the same way as in numpy. 
Thus the result of the following assignment is not well defined:

    v['A',1:3,1:3] = [[11,12], [21,22]]

Depending on the internal order of the item assignment it may set
v['A',1,2] and v['A',2,1] either to 12 or to 21. A similar problem 
may occur with tags 'B' and 'C'.


Subspaces spanned by basis vectors
----------------------------------

We also use the sparse representation to describe subspaces of R_p 
generated by basis vectors. Function sparse_subspace() creates a 
numpy array describing such a subspace. Note that the
characteristic p need not be known for describing such a subspace.

Subclasses of class AbstractMmRepSpace
--------------------------------------

A subclass of class AbstractMmRepSpace must implement the following
methods:

zero:
should return the zero vector

iadd:
vector addition, see class AbstractRepSpace for details.

imul_scalar:
scalar multiplication, see class AbstractRepSpace for details.

imul_group_word:
multiply a vector with an atom of the group Mm,  see class 
AbstractRepSpace for details. See class MGroupN for decomposing
an element of Mm into atoms.

reduce:  
Reduce the representation of a vector to a standard form. This is  
not necessary if each vector has a unique internal representation.

as_sparse:
Converts a vector (which is an instance of a subclass of class)
AbstractRepVector to its sparse representation. This function 
should return a numpy array containing the sparse representation.


getitems_sparse:
Support for reading components of a vector with __getitem__.
This method takes an array of integers containing the descriptions
of the basis vectors for which the co-ordinates are to be read.
Here the basis vectors must be given in sparse format.
In that array, the function must update the fields containing 
the coordinates.

setitems_sparse:
Support for writing components of a vector with __setitem__.
This method takes an array of integers containing the descriptions
of the basis vectors for which the co-ordinates are to be written,
and the co-ordinates.
Here the basis vectors must be given in sparse format.


additems_sparse:
Support for item assignment on a vector with __setitem__.
This method takes an array of integers containing the descriptions
of a vector v in sparse format. It add vector v to a given vector.


equal_vectors:
Check if two vectors are equal.

optional methods:

set_rand_uniform:
randomize a vector a uniform distributed

    'i1' are two integers or small letters indicating a random
    number. A scalar multiple of a basis vector may be written as

    Method self.unit(scalar, tag, i0, i1) or self.unit(tag, i0, i1) 
    can be used to construct a (scalar multiple of a) unit vector.

    Here 'tag' is a single capital letter representing the tag 
    of the unit vector, and i0 and i1 are integers.

    Valid tags are 'A', 'B', 'C', 'T', 'X', 'Y', 'Z' as described       
    in mm_aux.c, and also 'D' with 'D_i' meaning 'A_i_i'.

def sparse_subspace(*args):
    """Create a sparse representation of a subspace of MM vectors
    
    The function returns the description of a subspace of the space 
    R_p spanned by basis vectors of R_p. That description is returned
    as a sorted numpy array of type uint32. Each entry of that array 
    describes a basis vector in sparse representation (with component 
    'value' set to zero). 

    Each argument describes a subspace of R_p; and the span of all 
    these subspaces is returned. An argument may be:

    - A set or an array-like object containing integers
        Then all entries are interpreted as sparse representations
        of basis vectors, ignoring the scalar factor. Integers not
        representing basis vectors correctly are ignored.
        This feature is not implemented in the current version!!!

    - A tuple (tag, i0, i1) representing a basis vector.
        Here a tuple is interpreted as a vector in the same way as 
        in a call to an instance of class AbstractMmRepVector. 
        Note that such a call is used for generating a vector.

    - A vector v in a vector space R_p
        Here the vector space R_p must be an instance of a 
        (subclass of) class AbstractMmRepVector, and v must be a
        vector in that space. Then v describes the subspace spanned 
        by all basis vectors where the coordinate of v is not zero. 
        This feature is not implemented in the current version!!!
