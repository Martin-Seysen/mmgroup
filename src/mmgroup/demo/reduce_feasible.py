r"""Module **mmgroup.demo.reduce_feasible**: reduction of a feasible axis


Here the *feasible axes* are certain axes in the representation
:math:`\rho_{15}` the Monster, see :cite:`Seysen22`, Section 9.1
for details. They are in a one-to-one correspondence with the
left cosets of the subgroup :math:`H = G_{x0} \cap H^+` of the
group :math:`H^+` defined in :cite:`Seysen22`.

Thus mapping an arbitrary feasible axis **v** to the standard
feasible axis :math:`v^-`  corresponding to the subgroup :math:`H`
is equivalent to mapping an element of :math:`H^+` to an element
of :math:`H` by right multiplication.

The process of finding an element :math:`g` that maps a feasible
axis **v** to :math:`v^-` is called *reduction* of the feasible
axis  **v**. Function **reduce_feasible_axis** in this module
reduces an feasible axis  **v**.

The algorithm in function **reduce_feasible_axis** for reducing
a feasible axis is discussed in :cite:`Seysen22`, Section 9.
This algorithm is quite similar to the algorithm in function
**reduce_axis** for reducing a general axis. Analogies
between these two algorithms are summarized in Table 2 in
that section.

A orbit of :math:`H^+` under the action of :math:`H` will be called
a :math:`H`-orbit. As in function **reduce_axis**, we repeatedly
multiply a feasible axis first with an element of :math:`H` and then
with a power of :math:`\tau`. This way we will map the axis into a
'simpler' :math:`H`-orbit in each step of the reduction process.

Details of that reduction process are discussed in :cite:`Seysen22`,
Section 9. Possible sequences of :math:`H`-orbits obtained during
such a reduction process are shown in Figure 3 in that section.

A orbit of the Monster under the action of :math:`G_{x0}` will be
called a :math:`G`-orbit. Note that disjoint :math:`H`-orbits
lie in disjoint :math:`G`-orbit, with the following exceptions.
:math:`H`-orbits **'2A0'** and **'2A1'** are in :math:`G`-orbit
**'2A'**; and :math:`H`-orbits **'2B0'** and **'2B1'** are in
:math:`G`-orbit **'2B'**.

The reduction process mentioned above terminates if the
feasible axis is in the :math:`H`-orbit **'2A0'** or **'2A1'**.
Orbit **'2A1'** is the singleton :math:`\{v^-\}`, so that we
are done in that case. Transforming a feasible axis from orbit
**'2A0'** to orbit **'2A1'** is easy.
